>“*Mages* are human with an Awakened soul, but the Avatar of the Nephandi mages have been inverted and deformed. Practicing a new strain of corrupted spherical magic, the Qlippothic spheres. Supposedly also called anti-Spheres, they are built to destroy rather than to manipulate or create.”

# Personal Information

`[ History ]`
- *Age 1 - 17 // 1944 - 1961*
	- Silver was born something of an extraordinary child to the cult, he was born with an overwhelmingly large supply of mana. Alongside being born “infected” by the Outer Darkness, something that was never seen outside of Emilio himself. The man didn’t hesitate to train his child early in magic to both control that power, but also nurture his heir.
	- Silver would prove to be something of a child prodigy when it came to Qlippothic Sphere magic, with studies starting so early, the child barely had time to figure out who they were before they had to shape themselves around everything else. Their personality and identity became whatever surrounded his magic and the cult, nothing else matters than to achieve the highest power and bring about the patron’s arrival.
	- One thing that Silver did manage to find comfort in was their ability to call to the Outer Darkness, something that not even their father could do. Calling upon its lesser beings to accompany them, lovingly called their friends and compared to mage’s familiars despite their grotesque appearance and nasty behavior.
	- Emilio couldn’t be prouder when they found out this timid and scared child managed to destroy a room out of fear, killing their tutor, Rosario García Loyola in the process in a burst of emotions. Paying attention to Silver from the shadows where the child remains oblivious to, it inevitably spurred competitive members of the Nephandi cult to more malicious means to get Emilio’s attention. Silver would be faced with more ridicule and bullying from younger members of the cult while elders would often look down or envy them.
	- This fear slowly bubbled into frustration and immense paranoia, Silver would treat everyone with a sense of arrogance and aggression. Holding them at an arm’s length and never trusting a word they’ve said.
	- If an argument broke out, Silver would be the first to throw hands even if they lost a majority of the fights they’ve picked. It sowed distrust among the cult members as their so-called “Beacon of Darkness” started to show signs of disobedience, the first sign of the cult’s inevitable fall.
- *Age 17 - 19 // 1961 - 1963*
	- When Silver became of age, the cult members had pushed their caul ritual early in hopes that it would discipline the child. Keeping them in line by reminding of their cause, throwing Silver into the Caul without a second thought. Something Silver had dread their whole life. However, the influence of the Outer Darkness made this place a lot worse.
	- Try as they may, Silver could not escape despite the protesting. Wrangled and held down, the mage was constrained and thrown into the Caul to hurry the work along. At first, there was only the darkness but as the “wall” started to shift and visages of the imprisoned fallen appeared, Silver could only clutch their own head to lessen the pain.
	- Everything hurts. Their head throbbed, their blood burned, their skin felt like cracking and ripping itself apart and their eyes bled acid. They scream until their throat becomes hoarse, their hands clawing at their own face in hopes the pain would stop. Silver could barely crawl themselves out of the embodiment of hell to succeed the trial, receiving reluctant approval of the elders who are to oversee the trial despite Silver… pathetic display.
	- Silver officially became a Nephandi mage, their mind broken and shattered. Whatever the cult or Emilio demanded, Silver quietly obliged. To act as the prized doll of the cult, to be shown off as the true embodiment of an angel’s child that would bring peace to them. Forcing the mage to conduct every horrid act possible, to scam people from their life savings, exploit the poor and worse of all, kill to get what they wanted.
	- The cult had become increasingly more dangerous and aggressive since Silver’s birth, even arousing alarm from the local Kindred court to their acts. None of that was Silver’s problem; they just had to listen. With each splatter of blood upon their hands, Silver could only blindly obey the commands in hopes that they could feel something… or to feel nothing. An ever present reminder that this is what they were meant to do, to hurt people.
	- However, their acts brought to a boiling point with the Kindred Court in the Basque Country who had enough of their overindulgence in atrocities and power. They wanted to show the cult that no human could win against the powers of a Kindred, and to not become too cocky.
	- The cult had the backing of certain… politicians in the government at the start of the Cold War that feared the threat of nuclear weapons, and when they discovered the Outer Darkness’ power, had contacted Emilio to create him biological weapons. Especially one Ander de Guernica Echeverría, a corrupt politician who quite enjoyed taunting Silver.
	- Thousands of Daemon would be tested to merge with human volunteers, magical objects and even otherworldly sources of magic but none would last.
	- However, with enough pressure, they were forced out of their lands. Emilio setting their sights on more grandiose goals to achieve “Ascension” as the Unnamed has. They set forth to America, claiming that the Land of the Free would have more open-minded people that would understand their motives and goals.
	- Ascension in this case is not the Mage term, but to literally transcend beyond human bounds. Like the Unnamed who is now essentially immortal and all powerful, he would only appear in the Material Plane during Apocalypse.
	- Settling in Los Angeles to further expand their cult, setting rather solid roots down but with the move, not every cult member had been able to follow. Alongside the presence of Fera, more dangers are present within the city of Los Angeles.
- *Age 19 - 21 // 1963 - 1965*
	- They had to become a lot more discreet with their methods in a new city, to avoid crimes pinned upon them in a new place where their influence barely existed. While they managed to gather followers, Los Angeles was a lot more… progressive. With established Mage, Fera and Kindred communities, it became harder to trick people and to exist within the city confined without being found.
	- Crack downs upon their cult became a lot more common as member after member were arrested and sometimes executed for their crimes as a Nephandi mage. Silver couldn’t have felt more fear about being discovered in a foreign country where they barely learned the language, they had to obey the cult, but at the same time the overwhelming fear from their broken mind was becoming too much for them.
	- When the cult tried to be too ambitious by taking down the local mage council, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back, almost everyone was arrested and trialed for their crimes that the council has acknowledged back from their home country. With their leader, mysteriously disappearing into thin air when trouble befell the cult.
	- It was a surprise to find the supposed “heir” of the cult, who seems rather distant compared to the delusional cult members. Like they somehow retained their sanity despite the torturous trials of going through a Caul, Silver was taken in for interrogations before their trial. Where an influential archmage, Morgan Grimhild who had been requested over from San Francisco to oversee the interrogation as a mind mage, but she saw potential in Silver.
	- Silver wasn’t murderous by nature, they were forced to such acts and didn’t know any better. Their aggression had been nothing more than a defensive act before the unknown, and this was a child that could be nurtured, not criminalized. Silver was given a chance by the archmage, to gain the freedom they craved but under the supervision of people with intentions they did not understand.
	- They had to take the gamble, for the alternative would be death. To be given a lighter sentence in exchange for complying with the Mercurius Maximus Academy’s teachings and curriculum. Silver did not trust Morgan, but this was their chance of escaping. They just needed to lay low for a while.

# Abilities

`[ Boon ]`
- *Space and Time.* As a bonus action, Silver may teleport to a space anywhere within their peripheral vision by ripping a hole in the fabrics of space. However, this is nullified for 1 turn if Silver takes damage in the previous round.
- *Gift of the Damned.* As long as there are organic substances around Silver such as plant life or blood, he may siphon 1 HP from them to heal passively when injured. However, this increases his Resonance and makes others around him feel uncomfortable.
- *My Best Friends.* When in serious danger or disadvantageous situations such as being grievously wounded, cornered or stressed, the Daemons will appear to give Silver advantage on 1 stat for as long as the situation lasts. Nullified when the situation no longer applies.

`[ Bane ]`
- *Hereditary Greed.* If Silver uses magic constantly (2 ability activations and above, excluding passive abilities) in back-to-back role play/combat, the Daemons will limit them to tier I abilities and boons for said roleplay until they rest.
- *Reality Bender.* Paradox lashes back at them more dangerously due to the nature of a Nephandi's inverted Avatar. If there are sleepers present and Silver uses vulgar magic, they receive d2 damage each round. If it is a large crowd of people, they receive d4 damage each round.
- *Temptation's Call.* It calls. Tempting Silver’s return, if they show even a sliver of weakness, that temptation will take the chance and strike. Hoping to drag Silver back home. During roleplays, if Silver rolls Resolve of 5 or lower, they will receive disadvantage for Resolve for the next 3 rolls.

`[ Passive ]`
- *Pattern Awareness.* Enhanced magical perception, Silver is able to perceive exact spatial distance, detect organic beings, and small changes to "space" that normally can’t be perceived such as the "weight" of footsteps or movement, trails of “breathing” in Life energy, and “frayed seams” in Patterns caused by magic.

`[ Primary ]`
- *The Kill Zone.* Silver is quite adept at spatial control, from manipulating objects telekinetically, creating invisible kinetic forces or controlling gravity. He may sharpen the kinetic force to cut or manipulate gravitational force to make an object lighter. This ability range starts out at 5 ft and can only reach up to 20 ft. It expands 5 ft each turn and if interrupted.

`[ Supportive ]`
- *Viscous Web.* Life energy is siphoned and mutated to create a goop -like substance that can harden. When a target is affected by this, this will have disadvantage on Dexterity until they forfeit 1 turn to remove the hardened goop. Outside combat, may have utility usage to create objects.
