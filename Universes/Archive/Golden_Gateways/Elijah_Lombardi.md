# Personal Information

`[ History ]`

- *Age 1 - 16 // 1893 - 1909*
	- Elijah was an orphan at an orphanage amidst the financial issues Italy was facing, but the lack of actual support and horrid environment had forced them to run away to actually survive.
	- He had to pickpocket from whoever he could, survive by stealing food and even fighting over it with the other crooks and criminals of the crime ridden streets of Sicily. Elijah has had glimpses into an unknown world many times but none of that was enough to awaken him until a Kindred attacked, forcing him to face the horrid reality of monsters and demons.
	- Thankfully, Elijah manifested his magic just in time to fight off the starved Kindred and was promptly saved by Enzo Lombardi, who had been “coincidentally” there and took an interest in Elijah's magic. Enzo was a well known criminal, the new head of the mafia ever since he took down the previous one and reformed the mafia.
	- Elijah didn’t have much of a choice, and Enzo was offering a life of luxury compared to how he had been living in the streets. He would be trained and groomed to be a proper mage and member of the mafia, placed through trials to challenge his other “siblings” to show their worth.
	- It was gruesome and painful, and the longer Elijah stuck around, the more he started to realize he shouldn’t have taken the offer in the first place. There was no escaping the mafia now, not when they have eyes and ears everywhere and the ability to burn down buildings in a flash.
	- Enzo was a deranged man, obsessed with achieving ascension. Thus, has entrusted his “children” to seek the path of ascension for him. The man strongly believed in the magic of the Time, Life and Entropy to achieve such, and would push those ideals onto Elijah in harsh training. Despite it all, Elijah would continue to train his Matter sphere in secret, finding it a lot more fascinating than reaching immortality.
- *Age 16 - 23 // 1909 - 1923*
	- Enzo grew frustrated with Elijah’s lack of progress with his Time magic and as punishment, he was forcefully engraved with magical tattoos to enhance his magic. The process had been torturous. It certainly enhanced his magic, but Elijah also often lost control of the Time magic he possessed. Either way, it was satisfactory enough for him to be treated as the right hand man of Enzo and execute his orders.
	- Elijah worked as a hitman, essentially. Went out to kill those who went against Enzo and their mafia gang. The training and the competitions had made Elijah wary, especially when any of his “siblings'' could pull a gun on him at any time. The more they worked, the more they despised and realized this isn’t how they imagined life to be.
	- However, Defying Enzo’s words was just a death wish as Elijah would learn as he failed to kill a rival mafia’s member, Francesco Diamante and had to face the horrors of being repeatedly beaten and healed by Enzo. Elijah would “learn his lesson” to be more obedient and was later sent to America for a joint mafia expansion, to travel to a foreign country and to quickly learn a new language.
- *Age 24 - 27 // 1917 - 1920*
	- Elijah was sent to New York as a representative to expand the mafia’s influence. Thankfully, this also meant he had a lot more freedom away from the eyes of Enzo. In secret, Elijah started to look for help, and lucky for him, a certain group of Imbued happened to be in town and Gerard Toribio responded to his calls for help.
	- The plan was simple, Elijah would set their buildings on fire to destroy their stock and documents while Akeem Diop dealt with the legal ramifications of such for Elijah.
	- Elijah would end up traveling with the group, learning and sympathizing with Awakeneds from all walks of life, and even understanding the struggles of a hunter as an otherworldly being rattles their mind.
	- Their endeavors in New Orleans were… eye-opening and Elijah was forced to face the reality that not everyone is going to enjoy the presence of the hunters, who they saw as horrid and bloodthirsty despite the fact they were the ones who saved him. While the hunters agree to leave after everything had been resolved, Elijah would still return and visit his sworn brother and Gerard’s family. Most time was spent wandering the world with the association, continuing a never-ending dream.
- *Age 27 - 32 // 1920 - 1925*
	- Sometimes, Elijah would pay a visit to a particular individual that had been the subject of suspicious activity a few years back. In a fortunate turn of events, it seems the mage, Jaime Sánchez Alcaraz is doing fine and has even turned over a new leaf. Elijah was even able to persuade the usually closed-off man to teach him about magic, in a technomancer manner.
	- Under Jaime’s suggestion, Elijah also had joined the Sons of Ether tradition, mostly for the resources and information they could provide for him. The Sons of Ether were by no means charity workers, but as long as Elijah contributed to their ranks, he would be allowed to receive aid.
	- While Elijah’s magic grew stronger with his understanding, his general disinterest with achieving status confused and frustrated many of the Sons of Ether members. They wanted his ideas and designs and could only do so if he had more connection with the Tradition pressured into receiving a position to do so.
- *Age 32 - 44 // 1925 - 1937*
	- As he grew more powerful, so did Gerard. The imbued grew to an extent that surpassed the mortal limits of a human as if becoming a holy being itself. Alas, the Elohims were not merciful beings, creating such a vessel for themselves to descend and finish their work once a for all.
	- That is if they ever got to the vessel first… Gerard was yet another unfortunate soul who fell victim to the claws of the Fallen, using whatever divine power they have left to possess the vessel.
	- In a bloodthirsty rampage, the demon who recently gained immense power and freedom would cause mayhem. No matter what Elijah did, he couldn’t save his father. In the end, he had no choice but to put his own father down, killing the vessel and finally freeing Gerard from the grasp of both the Elohims and Fallen. In a tearful goodbye, Elijah would promise to live on their dream, to create peace for the people.
	- Gerard was buried back in New Orleans with his brother's family. With their leader gone, Akeem left not long after, except for a select few who still wanted to realize their nigh-impossible dream.
- *Age 44 - 47 // 1937 - 1940*
	- After Gerard's death, Elijah founded LARCAI, The Luminary and Rehabilitating Center for Awakened Individuals to help as an established organization to help Awakeneds, Sleepers, and Imbued alike in the memory of his deceased father. They acted much like social service for the Awakened world, with their own department working towards helping those in need while their fieldwork agents are responsible for actively rescuing people in danger.
	- Elijah managed to get it recognized by the mage councils through the Sons of Ether and various other Awakened associations.
	- While Elijah had founded it, he allowed someone else to take control of it as the director. Delegating himself to take care of the more alarming problem at hand of directly rescuing people as part of the Vanguard squadron, especially when LARCAI grew a lot bigger than he could handle.
	- Elijah still had his own way of contributing nonetheless, as he established a lot of orphanages with proper funding for better environments and living situations for children. In his personal time, Elijah would also work towards dismantling the corrupt nature of the Technocratic Union.
- *Age 47 - 52 // 1940 - 1945*
	- As Italy declared war on Germany and joined the Allied Forces, Elijah took volunteers with him to Europe in an effort to save people. They helped Awakeneds trapped in the war and provided sanctuary for those escaping. He was helping anyone that Italy invaded and also Italians who found themselves stranded. Providing them safe passage to certain LARCAI bases in the US.
	- However, spending way too long and near the battlefield for his liking, Elijah developed certain fears during his time there. Mostly involving large explosions and tight spaces as Elijah was buried alongside some civilians for hours with injuries making him unable to perform magic, they were later rescued but not all of them survived.
	- He also helped the Allied Forces invade occupied Sicily alongside old mafia contacts. While fully severed from mafia relations, Elijah still used whatever he knew to aid in the invasion to prevent further destruction by the Axis Powers. Making several allies in Italy and they also formed their version of LARCAI with collaborative bases there too.
	- When World War II finally ended, Elijah returned to the United States weary, but everything was made better with the birth of his niece, Jacqueline Strand-Diamante. He stayed in New Orleans for a while longer to stay with his brother’s family. Elijah loved the new friends and family he made in New Orleans, but nothing could really tie him down just yet.
	- Leaving once again to continue his work, sometimes even moving between countries as LARCAI continued to expand.
	- When Elijah finally mastered his understanding of the Prime sphere and realized what he could do with this power — rescuing Imbued from Elohims, he could only regret that he didn’t learn it sooner to save the Imbued around him.
	- During his more recent expedition, Elijah had to confront a demon who… brought up his more traumatic experiences of life, yet another curse placed upon his mind as these flashes would repeatedly be brought up in stressful situations.
	- Not only did it affect Elijah's performance on his job, but also his mental state. His most trusted coworker, the director of LARCAI, Augustine Ainsworth persuades Elijah to temporarily take time off from work.
	- Reluctantly, Elijah would finally agree after Augustine’s intense persuasion and settled to settle down for a bit, perhaps looking for a more passive method to continue his work from behind the scenes.

# Abilities

`[ Boon ]`
- *Eyes of the Dreamer.* Elijah can perceive the theoretical structure and component of magic and Patterns around him, allowing him to further understand the origin of a certain magic, its effects, type and power. Used in tandem with Ars Magica to better control and use said magic.
- *Touch of Altercation.* With a simple touch, Elijah can alter the properties of whatever they touch. Turning something that is soft into something hard, turning loud shoes into quiet footsteps, transforming a solid door to become jelly-like or even alter sticky gloves for climbing.

`[ Bane ]`
- *Vanguard Front.* When under high stress and in the presence of certain triggers, if he fails a Composure DC of 15, Elijah’s magic would go a tad out of control and their usual magic damage would drop to a d3 until they’ve calmed down or retreat.
- *On the Clock.* Without his devices, Elijah will have disadvantage on rolls regarding Time magic. If he were to lose his devices, Elijah could suffer from magic lash back, skewed perception of time, moving faster than time, stuck in a slowed time trance and even being forced to rewind traumatic memories in his mind. In combat, these can cause Henry to take +2 damage.

`[ Passive ]`
- *Lost Epoch.* While capable of performing other time magic techniques, Elijah favors locking time for an entire room or a target. However, if attacked or injured in this state, in the event of failing their Resolve DC of 12, this magic is nullified.

`[ Primary ]`
- *Ars Magica.* Controlling magic itself using Prime and used in tandem with other spheres. They are able to control, redirect, dispel magic or even use pure magical essence as a weapon. However, when dispelling magic or even Paradoxes, if the target’s Resolve roll is higher, damage is reflected on Elijah instead.

`[ Supportive ]`
- *Overhaul.* Elijah can change the shape and properties of matter. Allowing them to shape, destroy or even combine matter in various forms to create brand new tools, weapons or even just shaping the terrain. Limited to the size of a wall.
