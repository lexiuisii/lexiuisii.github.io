# Personal Information

`[ History ]`
- *Age 1 - 25 // Heian Period 1140 - 1165*
	- Rei started out as just a normal fox, and lived a simple life of hunting and sleeping. However, as she grew older, she started becoming aware of everything around. A natural phenomenon of a fox becoming a Kitsune, gaining wisdom and intelligence about the world.
	- Her curiosity started out small, testing her understanding of the farmer’s schedule that she lived by. Slowly testing out more and more activities that she saw humans performed, opening doors, sneaking in their houses and even harvesting some fruits.
	- As the spirit world was slowly introduced to Rei, she started to become curious of them too.  The spirits met her enthusiasm with the same energy, teaching her how to perceive the unseen, to utilize their powers and to pay respects.
	- Rei absorbed all that knowledge before becoming bolder and bolder, she went from tricking a human with a decoy, actively reaching out to her fellow yokais, to switching roles with humans to steal their jobs.
- *Age 25 - 40 // Heian Period 1165 - 1180*
	- Once, they were a treasured onmyouji of the Bureau of Onmyō as a prodigy onmyouji. They studied divinations, astrology studies and duty to protect the living against the spirits and apparitions. Serving the Imperial Court as their most trusted advisor regarding the Awakened world, they remember being close to the troubled young emperor. A poor young man forced to take upon an overbearing duty, but Rei was by his side the best they could be.
	- Well, that was before their “untimely demise” at the hands of a samurai. A coup that started with a slaughter, Rei was just among the unfortunate collateral damage. With a grievous wound, Rei would seek sanctuary in the spirit realm for a couple decades to come to recover the much needed spiritual energy. Slumbering away to regain whatever she lost. Spending about 40 years sleeping.
	- Rei traveled Japan far and wide mostly as a fox after the event, learning more about yokai, curses and deities of the land. Even learning the local cuisines and alcohol to spice up her deity of eating wild berries, prey and sometimes human energy. She would often steal bottles of sake from shrines and temples, enjoy her day through a drunken blurry haze and fooling around. 460 years of wandering as a fox.
- *Age 540 - 560 // Edo Period 1720 - 1740*
	- Rei was forced to take upon a human disguise once more. During a period where people have grown paranoid of foxes, calling them to be goblins and evil spirits, what better way to hide than to be among them? Rei didn’t have much of a choice during their hiding. It was a coincidence that she found a recently deceased child and took their identity.
	- They took the role of the son of Daimyo, trained and studied to be the very thing that killed them. It was expected of them to lead their army into wars, to bring glory to their clan and to become the samurai that would herald the daimyo they were serving. Meeting their second “unfortunate demise” in war, Rei barely had enough energy to crawl her way to a safe zone in the spirit realm and slumbered there to recover for the next few years. Spent another 40 years healing.
- *Age 600 - 610 // Edo Period 1780 - 1790*
	- Hoping to seek new powers, mages have invaded and discovered the injured fox’s sanctuary. A weak Rei escaped but her wounds have yet to heal, passing out while hiding away in an abandoned building. When she woke up, Rei would realize they had been rescued and patched up by Tsukiyama Izumi and Konoe Ayaka.
	- They were a prestigious family of mages within the Akashic Brotherhood, one with close ties with nobility and the lost royal family. Rei would slowly become one of them as they showed their kindness, especially with her siblings Tsukiyama Aoi and Tsukiyama Haruki.
	- While Rei was different from the rest, she was nonetheless part of the family. They taught her the art of meditation, patience and the mind. The rest of the Akashic Brotherhood may be wary of Rei, but they certainly could not speak ill of a noble’s adopted child.
- *Age 610 - 640 // 1790 - 1820*
	- Peace lasted for a bit, until the Technocratic Union attacked the family on a vacation, a devastating blow to the world of mages as a prestigious family were ambushed and killed. Rei on the other hand, despite being a Reality Deviant, they found great interest in. They chained and caged the fox to be left to the whims of the Progenitors, poked, prodded and experimented with to their hearts' enjoyment.
	- Rei was locked up and used as a “battery” to power their experiments as her spiritual powers were considered an otherworldly source of energy. Studied as a creature that fascinated yet disgusted them, try as she may, Rei couldn’t escape their odd magic. Locked in cold isolated rooms, Rei could only call out to the spirits that whisper back to keep her sanity. Her capture lasted 10 years.
	- By some miracle, they were saved by the grace of the Shinto god, Inari Ōkami. Freed alongside many others, through another Kitsune that broke into a facility to cause havoc. Rei was taken in by the other Kitsune to a sanctuary of Inari, where they would recover and study under the Shinto teachings.
	- Rei thanked the deity by pledging loyalty to them, much like many Kitsune reaching high in power would. While a flimsy promise at first with Rei’s work ethic, but through countless miracles the deity has shown Rei it didn't take long for her to follow the cause.
	- She learned of vengeful spirits and how to deal with them, learned of the dark energies of the world that they have the ability to cleanse. Be it demons, the undead or otherwise.
- *Age 640 - 784 // 1820 - 1964*
	- However, nothing could really tie Rei down when she’s learned of such a vast world. While many fox spirits discouraged her from leaving their deity’s domain, Rei’s curiosity was insatiable. She left Japan to travel the world, from Asia all the way to Europe. Mostly enjoying her time outside the constraints of conservative views, and helping people in other ways nonetheless.
	- Asia: China, Mongol, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey (20 years)
	- Europe: Greece (1840), Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden (1895), Poland, Spain, Portugal (124 years)
	- 1914 - 1918: Spent helping people who were wounded in the battle in France, served as a field medic and sometimes cook
	- 1939 - 1945: Aiding people who had been faced with the tragedies of war, tending to the wounded, taking care of the sick and keeping up some form of morality. Spent mostly in England when the bombing happened.
	- Slowly, Rei garnered debts across the world, people who owed her favors and people who have something she wants. While it wasn’t her intention at first, Rei embroiled herself in criminal and even political cases that threatened her life.
	- She had been attempting to root out some infernalist for the “benefits” of the court, but turns out, the counsel of Primogen themselves had been orchestrating the whole thing while controlling their puppet Prince. It becomes difficult to do anything when people with entire armies of Ghouls and Kindred can hunt you down.
- *Age 784 - 785 // 1964 - 1965*
	- With not much choice left, with whatever trustworthy debtors favors (Prince of Luxemburg), she was “erased” from existence. A dart thrown to determine their final destination, Rei ended up in San Francisco with an agency started up along with a private investigator license forged for the coastal city to act as Rei’s cover and to temporarily hide her from the seeking eyes in the barrier of Lady Joan.
	- Luckily for her, Hector was an agreeable man in the political faction that she could aid in order to gain some trust and something her job suits.

# Abilities

`[ Boon ]`
- *Hidden Spirits.* Rei enters her spirit form that allows her to phase by physical objects and attacks. However, when damaged by magical attacks, she will be forced back into her physical form. Useful for playing support, as she can break in almost anywhere.
- *A Thousand Li.* Spiritual sight to perceive souls and spirits around, each target has their own unique soul signature that Rei can identify and monitor. She can also spot curses, possessions or otherwise soul-influencing magic placed on someone.
- *Kitsunebi.* Ghostly appendages that manifest as extensions of herself, Rei can control them to perform tasks from a distance but they can never be used to attack someone. If targeted, these appendages disappear upon taking any damage. They give off a weird numbing sensation when touched.

`[ Bane ]`
- *Timid Soul.* Foxes are naturally fearful of canines and other canine-like creatures. As such, Rei is often uncomfortable and even timid when around canines and canine-like Awakeneds. When faced with intimidation and or threatened by them, Rei has disadvantage on Composure checks.
- *Hoshi no Tama.* Better known as a fox marble or orb, it’s a piece of jewelry that contains Rei’s magical powers. If this orb is ever stolen or lost, their stats would all drop to 1 and Resolve is rolled at a disadvantage until the orb is retrieved. Thankfully, this orb is pretty well hidden.
- *Incomplete Glamour.* Whenever Rei takes on a human form they will always have a few supernatural traits that can expose them. Ranging from a fox-shaped shadow, reflection of their true self in a mirror, a hidden tail or fur covered body. Exposing her traits could sometimes even unravel her glamor entirely.

`[ Passive ]`
- Vulpine Charm. Rei exudes an aura of allure and charm, which allows her to seduce or more easily become friends with a target. It can also ease and comfort others. Activates after 4 turns, targets can roll Composure to resist. Nullified if Rei attacks them.
- *Spiritual Sleuth.* Rei can peer into the memory of spirits found in objects or a location to learn of their history. Capable of seeing what has happened to said or area, to give her more insight into various scenarios. Objects might have limited vision while locations have blurry memories.

`[ Primary ]`
- *Purifying Aura.* A minty aura that purifies, capable of cleansing evil, healing minor wounds, purging disease and infection or dispelling curses. In combat, it may heal a target d4 HP. If the target is an "evil aligned" being, it may deal d4 damage instead.
- *Shiki no Kami.* Summoning spirits into her paper dolls, these dolls can stun Awakeneds upon contact. Targets who fail a Stamina roll against Rei's Resolve are stunned for 1 round, where they are unable to take any action or movement. Can be used outside of combat for utility usage.

`[ Supportive ]`
- *Shinki.* Calling upon her spirit friends, they can manifest into physical objects and items up to handheld size to aid Rei. Usually used for utility such as keys or a camera but they may also manifest as weapons. They last for 24 hours and those with supernatural senses may perceive its true nature.
