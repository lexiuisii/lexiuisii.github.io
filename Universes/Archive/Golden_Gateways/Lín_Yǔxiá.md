> “*Tian Gou*, 天狗 are black hounds sometimes mistaken as a comet, the Tian Gou, or Celestial Dog is the loyal gatekeeper of heaven. Known from the myth of them eating the sun and moon which causes the solar or lunar eclipse. Many perceive them as an evil spirit and would use firecrackers and loud drums to scare the Tian Gou away.”

# Personal Information

`[ History ]`
- *Age 1 - 13 // 1941 - 1854*
	- Had a relatively normal childhood, as normal as a child born to a Triad led by her father, Lín Hàorén (林浩仁) would be. A lively child who her parents struggled to keep an eye on as she would sneak off into the bushes, but their warmth and comfort were nonetheless present. The Traid’s actions were never related to the younger pups… not until they angered a grudgeful man.
	- Her mama, Medo Lhamo (梅朵 拉姆) saved her from the car driven directly at the family, but ended up passing away from the direct hit. Lin barely remembered the incident other than her hospital stay, returning to consciousness to a drunk, angry and mourning father with no patience for her.
	- Despite the child’s best efforts to connect, her father redrew further and further away from the one thing that reminds him of his wife the most. Lonely and shunned by her own father, Yuxia would find connections with the townsfolk that wouldn’t remind her of her father’s glares and absence.
	- When her father remarried, Yuxia almost felt betrayed, if not for the fact she was actually excited for the possibility of something akin to a family. Her step mother, Wú Dàiyü 吴黛玉 had been indifferent to her presence, blunt and calculating with her words. However, nothing could be compared to her excitement for a younger sibling. Yuxia had hoped for a companion, someone who would finally treat her like an equal, like a family.
- *Age - 13 - 18 // 1954 - 1959*
	- However, Lín Míngzé (林明泽) was nothing like she imagined. He was the quiet, obedient child her father always wanted. As they grew older, the difference became more and more prominent. Her father started to favor Míngzé over her, giving him the attention and approval as not only the clan head but also as a parent.
	- Yuxia couldn’t help but be angry at her brother, she knows he hasn’t done anything wrong, but she can’t help but feel betrayed. He was an ideal male heir of the family, the golden child her father always wanted. She just couldn’t compare no matter how hard she tried.
- *Age 18 - 22 // 1959 - 1963*
	- Taking that anger out on her work, shadowing clan members to do the dirty work of the court. One job to another, Yuxia did everything she could to prove she was worthy as a member of the clan. Even working by Lady Shufen and Yazhu closely to show her worth… but her father’s opinion wouldn’t sway.
	- Unknowingly, she lit the flames of their “rivalry” as Míngzé started to see her as someone he needed to put in place rather than someone he respected. He started growing arrogant and proud, openly showing off what he had over her. Splurging money, indulging in luxuries, overtly gambling, and showing that he could easily get work done with any actual hard work put into it.
	- It irritated Yuxia, who despite her best efforts, could never fit into the image of their family.
- *Age 22 - 24 // 1963 - 1965*
	- Over time, Yuxia became more jaded about her brother's attitude, deciding to be the “mature” one between the two, and mostly ignored Míngzé. She became more and more detached, even moving out of the clan house to live on her own as she tried to establish a life for herself outside of the clan.
	- That modicum of peace ended when her father announced Míngzé as the next clan head and his decision to retire, it reignited the anger within her as Yuxia stormed home to confront her brother.
	- One thing led to another, from an argument to a fistfight before the two siblings lit the night skies of San Francisco ablaze. In an attempt to stop the two, their father had been burnt and grievously injured by Lin. When the realization hit, the horrified and guilt-ridden Tian Gou could only tuck her tail and run away.
	- The next day, many denizens of San Francisco would realize the absence of a certain canine as she was reported to have disappeared into the night. Attempts to contact her came up fruitless, as Yuxia skipped town as quickly as she could. That night, the Tian Gou would also learn of the terrors beyond Lady Joan’s protection in San Francisco… but she couldn’t look back, she was too scared to look back.
	- For two years, Yuxia would jump around town, working as a bounty hunter and occasionally hunting down faerie and undead monsters alike to keep others safe. Staying under the radar while using an alias to earn a living had been hard, who knows what enemies her clan made that could be lurking in the next corner.
	- Out of nowhere, she received a call from home. Her clan is requesting her presence, claiming they needed someone to lead them, reporting on how much disarray the clan is in as Míngzé was exiled and her own father’s self-imposed isolation would leave them directionless. Had it not been for the fact they brought up Yazhu and Lady Shufen’s safety, Yuxia would have not returned home.

# Abilities

`[ Boon ]`
- *Soul of the Night.* She has sharper senses than the average human. Capable of seeing clearly in the dark as a hunter of the night, and is very sensitive to the sounds around her. She’s most likely to hear you before she would see you, whether it be from your footsteps, heartbeat or breathing.
- *Dark Hound.* Taking the form of the canine self, Yuxia can hide among Sleepers and blend herself in with the crowd when needed. Most will only sense that she is a normal hound unless they have supernatural senses to detect an Awakened.
- *Tracker's Instinct.* Scents and magic are seen as magical auras to Yuxia, each with their own appearance that she can smell, see and identify. Each Awakened and magical signature are unique to their user, thus she can easily identify allies from foes even under disguises and to track down the trails.

`[ Bane ]`
- *Scare the Shadows.* Yuxia is extremely sensitive to loud noises due to her enhanced senses. She rolls with disadvantage on Composure and needs to meet a DC of 15, upon failure she feels extreme need to stay away from the source.
- *Faithful Beast.* When a rope-like object is tied around Yuxia's neck, she becomes immobilized for 4 turns and pacified indefinitely until the object is taken off. These objects include necklaces, ties, ribbons and collars.
- *Insatiable Hunger.* Yuxia needs magic as a source of sustenance just as much as she needs food and water. She needs to regularly eat magic to stay healthy and have extra flavors. If forcefully starved, Yuxia has disadvantage on all rolls and becomes physically weakened.

`[ Passive ]`
- *Eclipse's Fangs.* Yuxia may take a bite out of someone's soul to devour its magical essence. The target's magic will have d2 of their magical damage/effectiveness reduced. However, if Lin were to receive damage after eating, it would be nullified.

`[ Primary ]`
- *Sidereal Blaze.* Fiery magic that Yuxia controls in various forms. When attacked physically, it releases a 5ft burst of flames to everyone around her including allies dealing d2 damage. With the exception of targets whose bodies are made of non-flammable substances.
- *Nebula's Maw.* Yuxia conjures spiritual energy to form a ghostly hound-like jaw that becomes an extension of her, capable of trapping and injuring its targets. Targets must pass a Strength DC of 12 to break out. Yuxia may control whether it hurts its target or not.

`[ Supportive ]`
- *Guidance of Sirius.* Shapeshifting into her werehound form, Yuxia can resist d2 damage from an attack every 2 turns. If the damage is persistent (such as poison or burning), it will continuously be lowered by the same amount and treated as the same attack.
