# Personality

`[ Positive Traits ]` 
- Loyal, Caring, Protective, Fearless Strong-Willed 

Gain Nona’s trust and you will gain an ally for life, she doesn't trust easily due to her past treatment but will become your most unwavering protector if she likes you enough. Despite her upbringing and past behavior, Nona is capable of being a caring individual to those she decided were to be under her care. Charging into battle for them or being their shield in the moment if ever needed, almost self sacrificially. 

`[ Neutral Traits ]`
- Curious, Flamboyant, Stubborn, Greedy, Playful

Chained to her role has made Nona an adventurous person, eager to learn about the world yet oblivious and ignorant at the same time. She comes off as a little insensitive and apathetic to some, but she is truly trying her best. Years of constant fighting had also made Nona a bitter and greedy fellow, whoever angers her will feel her wrath if she doesn’t get what she wants, though sometimes that may just be her teasing nature making fun of them.

`[ Negative Traits ]`
- Spiteful, Short Tempered, Possessive, Violent, Cruel

War is cruel and shaped Nona to be who she is, everything bad about war has been embodied by them. She is temprementral to those who underestimate and degrade her, become excessively vicious to those seen as enemies and would do whatever it takes to come out on top. While Nona has tried to rectify this behavior, habits and instincts are hard to ignore. Sometimes it's just hard to hold back her anger.

# Personal Information

`[ History ]`
*Birth*
- Born in the “slums” of their planet, to a captured human and high ranking pureblood.
- Their mother passed away early, didn’t met them while father ignored their existence.
- Their father tried to erase them but Nona’s a lucky bastard and survived the ordeal.
- They abandoned whatever Vastrix name were given to them and instead took on the name their human mother gave them, Wynona Silas.

*Childhood*
- Nona watched war and carnage from a distance as life in the slums was equally hard as the ones on the planets they have conquered.
- They learned of the stories of the other planets from other orphans and what victories and riches their greatest warriors bring back.
- He was treated as a “lower being” for being a half blood and was constantly picked on.
- Grew up pickpocketing, fighting and stealing to survive.
- As they got older the grew to spite the purebloods more and more, he wanted some way to prove he was just as good as any of them

*Teen*
- Forced their way into their military but was treated more like cannon fodder in the front lines.
- They were much younger than most of the other soldiers, at roughly around 18 years of age while the rest were usually 21+ the higher ups didn’t really cared as long as they had cannon fodder.
- But through sheer spite and tenacity, Nona became known as an incredible force in the front lines, the useless half blood who was plowing through the frontlines unlike any other of their own military men.
- It was a reluctant raise in rank, but they couldn’t hide the fact there exist a half blood as powerful as Nona, or as bloodthirsty.
- The higher ups came to an agreement that Nona can be very useful in their expeditions, and thus masked their despise for half bloods to raise Nona’s ranks in an effort to encourage him and others who hated that the half blood was a higher rank than them (very healthy competition).
- The cycle repeated again and again, Nona would be sent to the frontline to obliterate people while the higher ups praise and reward him for his efforts.
- Essentially raising him as a living weapon to be used in the frontlines, powerful and easily disposable

*Adulthood*
- Through bloodshed and war, Nona made himself a General of the military, but without any of the authority.
- He was still treated like a underling even by people of lower rank as long as they were a pureblood, pushed around and sacrificed for various reasons.
- Whether that be using him as a shield, taking on bombings or walking into traps.
- Often picked on by others, it made Nona a sensitive and reactive fellow, often doubting their point of living and has become more and more secluded.
- That seclusion and attempt to guard their own mind made Nona lose their individuality for the most part, losing who they once were as they try harder and harder to be more like “them”. The ideal Vastrix. Powerful and unchallenged.
- Things that they once loved were casted aside, their “personality” was nothing but what a stereotypical Vastrix would be, cruel, power hungry and arrogant. The only thing that kept them a slightly bit anchored was their own name, something the Vastrix didn’t own and saw as different.
- However, no matter how much Nona tried to fit into the ideal, they could never truly reach it. Often dismissed by higher ups because of their half blood status. Nona went from obedience to fury.
- Angered by such, he confronted the higher ups and challenged them to a duel to the death.
- Arrogant and prideful, they agreed to the terms that if he wins, he gets to take all their authority (which was allowed in their law, but in context was only made with purebloods in mind).
- At the end of the day, Nona was soaked in blood as he wore his “crown” home.
- The higher ups were quick to make amendments to said law after Nona’s stunt, but it no longer apply to him

*Domain Rule*
- He gained the rule of the ninth domain of the clan, which well, he didn't knew much about ruling.
- The people despised the fact that a half blood is now their ruler and rebelled against him. 
- Nona did what he knew best, retaliated violently.
- He showed what would happen if one were to rebel, he soaked the lands in blood of those who dared laid hands on him.
- Ruling his domain with fear and tyranny, lavishing in all the wealth and power he gets.
- All while the other higher ups sneer at him, a lowly half blood who thinks he has powers and influence, they pretend to entertain him as he was an essential weapon in the battlefield.
- The people under his rule despised the half blood but feared his power, they lived under him in reluctant compliance all while whispering rumors, bad mouthing and criticizing him.
- Nona ignored almost everything that had to do with ruling the domain, dumping it all on his advisors in favor of just sitting around as a figurehead.
- No one liked him, considered irresponsible, neglectful and a downright awful leader for the domain. But Nona didn’t care, he didn’t ask to be shackled to all this.
- Many attempts to start a coup were discussed, but a glance at the blood-soaked general returning from the battlefields tends to dissuade them. The last coup ended in a yard strewn full of bodies, after all.
- While his neglect is obvious and looked down upon, Nona’s domain was actually thriving a little better than most. He wasn’t taxing them with high rates, laundering their money or using it to purchase extravagant decorations. So, all things considered, while they hated a half blood ruler, they allowed him to stay for the “luxury” he provides.

*New Beginnings*
- The proxies had started taking over their conquered planets, wiping them out and leaving nothing but dust and destruction.
- As prideful beasts, the Vastrix were angered by such and sent out troops to hunt them down to no avail, including Nona.
- Frustrated by his performance on the battlefield, Nona turned to entertainment to indulge himself and forget about the troubles of higher ups berating him and threatening to take away his rank.
- He found entertainment in the battle tourneys the Vastrix would throw, battles to the death were a source of entertainment for Nona for quite some time, watching as pathetic warriors try to prove themselves worthy of something.
- But… the more he watched, the more he noticed something. This wasn't a trial to see who the best warriors are, this was a pit of death for the weak… for his kin, the half bloods.
- Day after day, half bloods were slaughtered for their entertainment as they struggled.
- Finally finding his bearings, he broke free of the delusions he was trapped in for so long.
- Finding solace in helping another half breed like him, Mharathi as half human Vastrix.
- He would sponsor them with everything hid money and power could, give them tips and tricks on how to win battles against the brutes.
- He was proud of how well they were doing in the tourney, but knew of the reality of the their promise for “freedom”.
- Mhara has talked about wanting to see what freedom was like, and Nona was going to make that happen.
- Unfortunately for him, the stunt he pulled could no longer be repeated

*Loss*
- He confronted the elders this time, with whatever authority he had as a ruler and general to demand for Mhara’s freedom.
- Little did he know they were just tolerating him for his worthy in battle, as soon as a half blood like him rebelled, they would receive punishment.
- In which Nona was punished severely, chained and slashed by swords, shot by dark matter and bullets alike to show the world how a half blood could never truly rebel against their true rulers.
- Broke his horn to shame him, as sign of his pride being ruined.
- He was released later, with grievous wounds and left bleeding in the streets, he crawled his way “home” to the slums to recuperate.
- Nona was left hopeless in a world where he didn't matter, the government had no use of him anymore and only have him some mercy to be used as a weapon in the future.
- The youngest elder, someone Nona who thought would understand him instead suggested that they throw Nona to the wolves — the proxies for his plan in secrecy.
- Claiming to give him everything once the plan succeeds, but Nona knows better

*Invasion*
- He hated the purebloods and every inch of corruption on this damned planet, if he was going to go down, he wasn't going down alone.
- Nona was the cause of their destruction, he had been instructed to lead the capture of as many proxies as they could get their hands on, caging them in their ships to be returned home.
- While the elders discussed about how great of a plan it was, blinded by his hatred, Nona wondered how well the Vastrix would fare against the infamous invaders.
- Without a second thought, he released them onto the planet to see what would happen. Maniacally joyous at the screams and sight of destruction, until he noticed innocent farmers, half bloods and slaves being torn apart too.
- He realized too late how big a mistake this was, they were thousands of innocent on the planet who didn't have any business with the elder’s pride and arrogance.
- Blinded by his anger and now full of regret and guilt, he couldn’t stop the invasion, there were too many of them and only one of him.
- And when the invasion started, he ripped everything that's precious to him and fled (aka its Mhara).
- Fleeing far far away to the last place the Vastrix would ever think to find them, confronting an old enemy to have a peaceful agreement for the sake of Mhara.
- Nona joined the CCC in hopes to mend his mistakes and give Mhara the freedom they always wanted, safe and away from the Vastrix.

# Abilities

`[ Proficiencies ]`
- *Silence of War*
	- The silence of war can mean two things, the beginning or the end. Nona has an aura of intimidation, with just a glare, they can instill fear into a target. Targets who fail a wisdom save will be frightened by Nona and have disadvantage on attacking her for 2 rounds. Can only be used on a target successfully once, will not work the second time.
- *Ground Zero*
	- Nona has gravitational powers from her control over dark matter, allowing her to manipulate the weight of targets. Making them lighter in her claws than to most.  Gains advantage on strength checks when used on a target when strength is needed.

`[ Deficiencies ]`
- *Blindness of Luminous*
	- The crawlers of darkness fear the light, even the ones bred to fight it. Much like the rest of his kind, Nona has extreme photosensitivity. Light makes his vision obscured and he can be temporarily blinded with large flashes of light. Extreme sources of light can “burn” him as Nona seems to be more sensitive to light than the rest of his kin, a punishment for his sins, perhaps.
- *Blood-Soaked Beast*
	- The Vastrix are a cruel and infamous race of aliens, the universe knows and holds their anger. Nona who looks more like a fullblood than most halfbloods often entices the anger of vengeance and fear from others. Disadvantage on Charisma checks to those who recognize him as a Vastrix.

`[ Primary ]`
- *Chaotic Entropy*
	- Wielding the power of dark matter, Nona can control its unstable energy to be fired at people. Its extreme gravitational pull condensed into a small orb can cause grievous wounds with just a scratch, laying destruction in its path. Rolls Dexterity to aim. Deals +2 Damage with this on attack rolls.
`[ Secondary ]`
- *Fragment of Darkness*
	- Coating himself in dark matter, it almost looks like Nona is wearing armor due to dark matter’s incompatibility with light. This “armor” is more like a layer of dark matter than repels attacks with its gravitation redirection. With this ability, physical attacks can be blocked/redirected with a successful Endurance roll check. Lasts for 3 rounds, twice per RP.
