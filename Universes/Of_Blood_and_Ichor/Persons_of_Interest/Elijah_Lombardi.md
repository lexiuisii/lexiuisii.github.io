`[ History ]`
- Abandoned and raised in an abusive orphanage, Elijah's early memories weren't the best. He often escaped to sleep on the streets just to get away from the orphanage caretakers, learning his way with scraps out of interest. Anything he could get his hands on, Elijah would try to dismantle and put it back together. 
- He was often found in the junkyard, taking whatever scraps he could to piece together a toy or tool for his own entertainment. Elijah was eventually caught by the junkyard owner, but the man left him to his devices out of sympathy. Even teaching the kid a few things about fixing up electronics. 
- Elijah would eventually find kinship with the owner, Salvatore and was hired as a part time repairman for broken electronics he got his hands on. However, Salvatore would get in trouble with the local mafia and find himself at their mercy. It was by sheer coincidence that the mafia head found interest in Elijah's skill and adopted the kid as "price" for Salvatore's life. 
- The mafioso would officially adopt Elijah on paper and take him under their wing, Enzo in particular found potential in his skills with electronics and started introducing firearms to him. Elijah would be guilt tripped and blackmailed into doing whatever Enzo wanted, using Salvatore as leverage. Despite the guilt of what the weapons were used for, Elijah found fascination in tinkering with the weapons. 
- Given a life of luxury compared to their time at the orphanage, Elijah would become disillusioned into serving Enzo to repay his kindness. Even sent to engineering school to get into weapons engineering, Elijah threw everything to ensure their place in the mafia. 
- However, whenever Elijah strayed from their purpose, caught tinkering with equipment that wasn't weaponry, he would be forced to watched it be smashed to bits and physically punished for disobedience. Years of being a mere puppet took a toll on Elijah, his passion for engineering faded and he became paranoid. 
- He tried to escape a few times, but laws of the mafia ensure that he would be punished severely for each transgression. It wasnt until he got in contact with Salvatore again that he was able to reach out for help and plan his escape. However, his plans were leaked and at some point he was captured and kneecapped. 
- Elijah successfully escape to America, but had a lasting injury to his knee's nerves and permanently left his leg weak. He had to undergo physio therapy to walk again and now uses a cane as disability aid. Thankfully, the degree they earned was still considered valid and Elijah manage to find a job as a technician. 
- Connection to their aid led to another, and now Elijah uses their speciality in weaponry against monsters instead of humans. Helping with building equipment and weapons to take down monsters and keep people safe.
