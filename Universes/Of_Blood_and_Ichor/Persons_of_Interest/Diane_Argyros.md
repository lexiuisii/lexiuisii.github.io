`[ History ]`
- Born in New York, America. Diane's life was neatly planned out for her even as a kid, with parents that expected their child to be exactly what they had in mind, a perfect golden child. Diane merely followed each step accordingly, to obtain desired grades, to get ahead on her studies, she was a smart child and easily got by most of the demands. 
- This also meant she married young, a wife arranged for her of upstanding status and behaviour. While it was a loveless marriage at first, Diane came to become fond of her wife. Someone who she didn't have to be the "perfect child" to, someone who even encouraged her to take her own path in life. 
- Diane's parents had expected, and even planned for her to be a doctor. A respectable and well paying job, but her interests had never been with human biology. Instead, she was more fascinating with the thriving critters of nature and their oddities. Diane had became interested in them after countless efforts of sneaking out to explore. 
- This sparked an outrage from her parents who became angered with Rafaela who supposedly "corrupted their child". One arguement lead to another and it became a physical confrontation that resulted in Diane's mother and Rafaela to be pulled into oncoming traffic. Both died at impact and it left Diane bitter and hateful towards her father who instigate the ordeal. 
- Heading towards her goal with spite, Diane used whatever money and connection she had at school to not only switched programmes into entomology but also seek out possible investors. She finished school without any problems, biology had always been her specialty. However, when her efforts to seek for investors came up empty, Diane only doubled down in more ambitious projects. 
- This caught the eye of a certain Tzimisce in the field, who became enthralled with Diane's ambition and fury. He wanted to have Diane's skills for himself and her is his own. He approached her with an offer, to gauge the entomologist's passion, which she reacted accordingly. Pleased with his choice, Dr. Frasier started slowly indoctrinating Diane to the Kindred world.
