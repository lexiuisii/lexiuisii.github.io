# Personal Information

`[ Relations ]`
- *William Edgar Bennett*, Father. 
	- British. 
	- Synthesium CEO.

`[ History ]`
- Born in London, England. Owen's parents divorced when he was just a young child, losing his mother and forced in his father's impassive control. Everything he did was dictated by his father, school, friends, activities and hobbies. He never managed them as well as expected, leaving Owen as a disappointment in the eyes of his father.
- As the control got tighter, Owen started to rebel. Using his father's influence and wealth to cause trouble, becoming an infamous playboy and bringing shame to his father's name. However, his father merely resolved everything without a blink of an eye. Money was power, and he has a lot of it. 
- Frustrated, Owen on impulse drafted himself into the military at an attempt to get away from his father's influence. He thrived in the environment despite the strict regime and rules, happy for once to not be under his father's control. Soon, he proved himself a good enough soldier to be drafted into a special task forced. 
- This task force turned out to be a Kindred hunting squad as part of the Second Inquisition to flush the world of vile beasts. Owen was more than happy to he a little violent when hunting down Kindred. He became well known among both his squad and Kindred to be a ruthless hunter, which made him a target. 
- Specifically to kill Owen in order to demoralize the Second Inquisition and halt their strike force momentarily. However, the Kindred responsible for the kill was instead interested in Owen as a pawn, they found Owen's ruthlessness and assertion an appealing trait. 
- In secret, Owen was embraced but when they awaken without their clan bane, he was promptly abandoned. Confused and fearful, Owen stumbled back to the Second Inquisition's base only to be captured and experimented with. After painful evaluation, Owen was deemed still useful to the force, but only as an obedient attack dog. Should he fail his task or disobey, his own teammates won't hesitate to gun him down.

# Headcanons

- Loves sweets, he enjoys any sweet treat and his form of love language is sharing or buying treats for others.
- Also a big fan of cooking, London's food sucks and he practiced cooking Indian curries and cuisines to survive.
- Very physically affectionate and will use his large size to his advantage.
- Dislikes being trapped or tied down, reacts very badly to such.
- He can play both the piano and violin, but he's very rusty and would probably play the wrong tunes half the time.
- Has a tattoo of an ouroboros with a knife through it on the back of his neck, which is actually the experimentation brand of Project Ouroboros.
- Owen was technically the heir to Synthesium, a pharmaceutical mega corporation before his time in the military.
- Officially pronounced dead on paper and in the tabloids, as Owen is by all accounts dead and to hide the project's nature.
- Had to grow a beard, combined with his scars and larger muscle to hide his identity when in public.
- He hums bits and pieces of a Norwegian folk song to himself when he's feeling scared or lonely, especially when Eir isn't around.
- Loved Pokémon as a kid, didn't get much chance to play it so he's making up for lost time now. He's not a very good strategy player, just enjoys collecting cool Pokémons.
- Misses his mom a lot, but doesn't dare to find out where she is because he isn't the same little boy he once was.... nor entirely human.
- Will play a silly tune on the piano for fun.
