`[ History ]`
- Born in Bangkok, Thailand. Nona was just an orphan being bounced around in the foster system with no actual home to return to. Frustrated with the fickleness, he took his life into his own hands. Mingling with gangsters even as a teen to find his place in the world, which he did, in gambling and scamming. 
- Nona was taken in by the local gangsters and thrived amongst them despite his aversion for violence, preferring to trick and misdirect. He made a name for himself for being a "lucky" gambler, so much so that he got in trouble. Luckily for him, the crime boss found Nona's foolish bravery quite amusing. 
- He was forced to work for them in exchange for his life, running errands and handling the gambling ring, but it didn't stop Nona from pulling his own strings using the gang's connection. Nona made relations with not just allies, but also rivals. Slowly pushing variables in his favor. A few years of climbing the social ladder meant Nona would finally achieve some power, being an advisor to their leader and making connections. 
- This got the attention of a certain Kindred, who had lead the Russian mafia's efforts to establish themselves in Thailand. Nona's ambition was something he became interested in and started reaching out. Nona became entangled in not just the Russian mafia but also the Kindred world, being introduced to the possibility that he too could become someone important. Nona became infatuated with the idea and did everything in his power to aid Sasha.
