<ul>
  <li><strong>Entities</strong> are extradimensional beings that invade our realm, disrupting the very fabric of reality and causing Corruption in everything around them. Turning the environment and its inhabitants into a danger as new vectors of the Corruption. They have been the origin of many myths of monsters and demons in history. Mundane electronic devices are disabled due to the presence of Corruption, only equipment infused with Aether are capable of functioning.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Aether</strong> is the bodily equivalent of blood harvested from deceased Entities that possess incredible paranatural properties. After processing Aether, it is capable of  stimulating regenerative properties in refined liquid form, exude high energy in crystalized form and more. Raw Aether is extremely volatile and can spread Corruption.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Corruption</strong> is the name of the disruptive paranatural energy that Entities emit, it breaks down the laws of reality, creates dimensional cracks and infects those who come into high concentration of it. Considered a severe reality hazard that must be contained, usually through elimination of the main vector of Corruption.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Amalgams</strong> are those who become infused with dangerous levels of Aether, causing the transformation into a pseudo Entity-like being with Aether Capabilities. This can be due to accidental exposure to Aether Corruption, Entity attacks or willing infusion of Aether. They are at risk of losing their sanity and mind, becoming mindless beasts should they lose control. </li>
  
  <li><strong>Aether Capabilities (AC)</strong> vary from each individual and equipment, but allows the users to manipulate the fabric of reality within their own constraints. Some can manipulate the elements around them, others can stimulate an Entity's space bending abilities and regenerative powers. Equipments are often limited to a single-type AC in order to avoid overloading the components. </li>
  
  <li><strong>Esoteric Technology (EsoTech)</strong> are technological equipment that have been infused with Aether, allowing its users to utilize Aether Capabilities without being an Amalgam but risk Aether Corruption should it malfunction. Many have safety features in place, but improper disposal or destruction of the equipment can cause Corruption.</li>

## Factions

- **Synthesium Technology Corporation (STC)** hides the existence of the Entities from the masses and `capitalize on the usage of Aether` to create advance technological weaponry and equipment to use against the Entities. They have connections to `governing bodies`, `law enforcement` and the `military`, and monopolize over the pharmaceutical, medical and military engineering industry. 
- **The Gilded Blade** consists of loosely organized `mercenaries and criminals` that specialize in hunting down Entities for the sake of `smuggling and selling Aether` on the black market. Many engineers in this connected to them `illegally make EsoTech` and possess highly flawed safety features, making them more `prone to malfunction`. Often directly at odds with STC as they also `steal EsoTech` from the corporation to be resold. 
- **Empyrean's Veil** is a `secret organization` of the `rich and wealthy` with their identity hidden behind masks at events. Their main goal is to get their hands on any and all `Aether or Entity related item`s, usually sold at auction events they hold. Only the most `elite` may join their ranks, Synthesium considers them a `threat` due to their knowledge of Entities and their arrogance. 
- **Progenies of Ichor** has followers that `worship Entities as gods` and deem Aether as `gift of the gods`. They considered Entities on Earth to be exiled gods, arranging hunts to harvest their blood as reparations for their sins. They `intentionally infuse members` of high ranks with Aether in order to become *Amalgams*, which are seen as a blessing and honor to become closer to `Ascension`. Many members have connections with other religious organizations.
