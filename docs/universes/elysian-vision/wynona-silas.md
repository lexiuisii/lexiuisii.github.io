<p><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">CONTENT WARNING </span>Violence, War and Implied Deaths</p>

<ul>
    <li>Born a Half-Vastrix in the slums, Wynona was shunned for their very existence as a "lower being". They fought tooth and nail just to survive under the thumbs of the fullbloods, hoping one day that they could get them back. Their chance came in the form of the military, that had been drafting even half-bloods like Wynona for the sake of being canon fodder for their conquest. Wynona wasn't about to let this chance slip away.</li>
    <li>They clawed their way up the ranks, throwing away all things that would make them any less, but was still treated like nobody. They were a General, but only in name. Frustrated by the system, Wynona challenged the very core of the Vastrix's rulership with a duel to the death that ended in their victory. At the end of the day, they went home with a crown of soaked in blood and newfound terror of their name.</li>
    <li>They were given their own domain to rule over, but had little to no interest in managing it. Leaving the task to those more well suited, while seen as a lazy ruler, it made their domain a lot more productive when an oppressive power wasn't bearing down on everyone. Full-bloods under his rule weren't exactly happy a half-blood was in charge, but it was better than a life of heavy taxes and ridiculous laws.</li>
    <li>When the Proxies started taking over the Vastrix's conquered planets, troops were sent out to reclaim their territory to no avail, including Wynona's. Frustrated with their own performance, they turned to something else for entertainment, the battle tourneys held on his homeplanet. It was amusing for a short while, but... the more he watched, the more he found kinship with the fighters. His kin, half-bloods like him who were killed just for the entertainment of others, like he was.</li>
    <li>Regretful of their own choices, Wynona found solace in helping out his kin in the tourneys. Providing sponsorships to help them out whenever he could, especially for a certain half-human Vastrix like him named Mhara. Wynona gave them tips on how to fight, tricks on fighting dirty and when Mhara wished for freedom, Wynona was going to try whatever he could to make it happen.</li>
    <li>Wynona confronted the Elders once more, but insulted by his sheer audacity to pull the same stunt twice, he was punished. Wynona's horn was broken as a sign of shame while their were brutally beaten and chained. As an elder suggested, Nona would be sent on a suicide mission for his disrespect. If he wants to survive, he just has to overcome the "odds". With Mhara's safety in danger, Wynona could only agree.</li>
    <li>The plan had been to capture the Proxies for something the Elders planned back home, but in a blind fury, Nona had released the merciless beast onto his own homeplanet to watch it die. Only grabbing a few of his trusted companions and fleeing with a stolen ship. Finding themselves seeking refuge at the CCC and agreement to join them for the safety of his companions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Silence of War.</span> 
       The silence of war can mean two things, the beginning or the end. Nona has an aura of intimidation, with just a glare, they can instill fear into a target. Targets who fail a wisdom save will be frightened by Nona and have disadvantage on attacking her for 2 rounds. Can only be used on a target successfully once, will not work the second time.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Ground Zero.</span> 
        Nona has gravitational powers from her control over dark matter, allowing her to manipulate the weight of targets. Making them lighter in her claws than to most.  Gains advantage on strength checks when used on a target when strength is needed.</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">Deficiency</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Blindness of Luminous.</span>  
        The crawlers of darkness fear the light, even the ones bred to fight it. Much like the rest of his kind, Nona has extreme photosensitivity. Light makes his vision obscured and he can be temporarily blinded with large flashes of light. Extreme sources of light can “burn” him as Nona seems to be more sensitive to light than the rest of his kin, a punishment for his sins, perhaps.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Blood-Soaked Beast.</span> 
       The Vastrix are a cruel and infamous race of aliens, the universe knows and holds their anger. Nona who looks more like a fullblood than most halfbloods often entices the anger of vengeance and fear from others. Disadvantage on Charisma checks to those who recognize him as a Vastrix.</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight: bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">Primary</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Chaotic Entropy.</span>  
        Wielding the power of dark matter, Nona can control its unstable energy to be fired at people. Its extreme gravitational pull condensed into a small orb can cause grievous wounds with just a scratch, laying destruction in its path. Rolls Dexterity to aim. Deals +2 Damage with this on attack rolls.</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">Secondary</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Fragment of Darkness</span>  
        Coating himself in dark matter, it almost looks like Nona is wearing armor due to dark matter’s incompatibility with light. This “armor” is more like a layer of dark matter than repels attacks with its gravitation redirection. With this ability, physical attacks can be blocked/redirected with a successful Endurance roll check. Lasts for 3 rounds, twice per RP.</li>
</ul>
