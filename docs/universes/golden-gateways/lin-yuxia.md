>  “Tian Gou, 天狗 are black hounds sometimes mistaken as a comet, the Tian Gou, or Celestial Dog is the loyal gatekeeper of heaven. Known from the myth of them eating the sun and moon which causes the solar or lunar eclipse. Many perceive them as an evil spirit and would use firecrackers and loud drums to scare the Tian Gou away.”

<ul>
    <li>Lin was born and raised in San Francisco, more so by the community and her own faction leader rather than her father. Her mama had passed away in a car crash when she was a young pup, and her father remarried and focused more on his heir than he did on Lin. She was nonetheless a lively pup that loved to bug and play with anyone who was willing to give her attention.</li>
    <li>However, as she grew older… Lin became more temperamental from clan business. Serving as an underling that would do anything Lady Shufen commands, many who defy the Red Deer Court would often find a growling hound at their doorstep. Lin was willing to do anything to prove her worth to the people around, while still finding solace to those around her that were willing to put up with the fiery hound.</li>
    <li>When the fight with her brother occurred, Lin was later reported missing as few witnesses would claim spotting the Tian Gou running away in the dead of night. Two years later, Lin would be called home by its elders and faction leader. Both to lead the crumbling clan and to serve the faction heir, which Lin reluctantly agreed if not for her adoptive brother's safety.</li>
