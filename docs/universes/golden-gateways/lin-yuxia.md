>  “Tian Gou, 天狗 are black hounds sometimes mistaken as a comet, the Tian Gou, or Celestial Dog is the loyal gatekeeper of heaven. Known from the myth of them eating the sun and moon which causes the solar or lunar eclipse. Many perceive them as an evil spirit and would use firecrackers and loud drums to scare the Tian Gou away.” {: .notice--info}

<ul>
    <li>Lin was born and raised in San Francisco, more so by the community and her own faction leader rather than her father. Her mama had passed away in a car crash when she was a young pup, and her father remarried and focused more on his heir than he did on Lin. She was nonetheless a lively pup that loved to bug and play with anyone who was willing to give her attention.</li>
    <li>However, as she grew older… Lin became more temperamental from clan business. Serving as an underling that would do anything Lady Shufen commands, many who defy the Red Deer Court would often find a growling hound at their doorstep. Lin was willing to do anything to prove her worth to the people around, while still finding solace to those around her that were willing to put up with the fiery hound.</li>
    <li>When the fight with her brother occurred, Lin was later reported missing as few witnesses would claim spotting the Tian Gou running away in the dead of night. Two years later, Lin would be called home by its elders and faction leader. Both to lead the crumbling clan and to serve the faction heir, which Lin reluctantly agreed if not for her adoptive brother's safety.</li>

</ul>

<span class="font-weight: bold" style="color:#008080;letter-spacing:1px;">BOONS</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li>Soul of the Night. She has sharper senses than the average human. Capable of seeing clearly in the dark as a hunter of the night, and is very sensitive to the sounds around her. She’s most likely to hear you before she would see you, whether it be from your footsteps, heartbeat or breathing.</li>
    <li>Dark Hound. Taking the form of the canine self, Yuxia can hide among Sleepers and blend herself in with the crowd when needed. Most will only sense that she is a normal hound unless they have supernatural senses to detect an Awakened.</li>
    <li>Tracker's Instinct. Scents and magic are seen as magical auras to Yuxia, each with their own appearance that she can smell, see and identify. Each Awakened and magical signature are unique to their user, thus she can easily identify allies from foes even under disguises and to track down the trails.</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight: bold" style="color:#008080;letter-spacing:1px;">BANES</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li>Scare the Shadows. Yuxia is extremely sensitive to loud noises due to her enhanced senses. She rolls with disadvantage on Composure and needs to meet a DC of 15, upon failure she feels extreme need to stay away from the source. </li>
    <li>Faithful Beast. When a rope-like object is tied around Yuxia's neck, she becomes immobilized for 4 turns and pacified indefinitely until the object is taken off. These objects include necklaces, ties, ribbons and collars. </li>
    <li>Insatiable Hunger. Yuxia needs magic as a source of sustenance just as much as she needs food and water. She needs to regularly eat magic to stay healthy and as extra flavors. If forcefully starved, Yuxia has disadvantage on all rolls and become physically weakened. </li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight: bold" style="color:#008080;letter-spacing:1px;">PASSIVE</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li>Eclipe's Fangs. Yuxia may take a bite out of someone's soul to devour its magical essence. The target's magic will have d2 of their magical damage/effectiveness reduced. However, if Lin were to receive damage after eating, it will be nullified. </li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight: bold" style="color:#008080;letter-spacing:1px;">PRIMARY</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li>Sidereal Blaze. Fiery magic that Yuxia controls in various forms. When attacked physically, it releases a 5ft burst of flames to everyone around her including allies dealing d2 damage. With the exception of targets whose bodies are made of non-flammable substances. </li>
    <li>Nebula's Maw. Yuxia conjures spiritual energy to form a ghostly hound-like jaw that becomes an extension of her, capable of trapping and injuring its targets. Targets must pass a Strength DC of 12 to break out. Yuxia may control whether it hurts its target or not. </li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight: bold" style="color:#008080;letter-spacing:1px;">SUPPORITVE</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li>Guidance of Sirius. Shapeshifting into her werehound form, Yuxia can resist d2 damage from an attack every 2 turns. If the damage is persistent (such as poison or burning), it will continuously be lowered by the same amount and treated as the same attack.
</li>
</ul>
