<p>At a glance, many would deem Owen nothing more than a <strong>suave</strong> flirt, as insincere as his words are sweet. His gestures and words may be <strong>romantic</strong>, but Owen is hardly one to be tied down so easily, especially with his job. His <strong>laid-back</strong> attitude comes as a oddity among his coworkers, who tend to take their job a lot more seriously than the <strong>fun-loving</strong> fool. In fact, those who work with may even describe Owen as <strong>uncooperative</strong> and <strong>disobedient</strong>, prefering his own defiant manner of getting things done.
</p>

<p>In truth, when it comes to his responsibilities, Owen takes things a lot more seriously than other peceive him to. He can be extremely <strong>efficient</strong> in tasks he was assigned to accomplished, usually the physical type but can easily <strong>adapt</strong> his methods to suit other needs. His words may be <strong>callous</strong> alongside being a little too <strong>foreful</strong>, but Owen's first instict tends to be to <strong>protect</strong> and his <strong>steadfast</strong> loyalty to those on his side are unwavering.
</p>

<p>In his own time, Owen may describe himself as <strong>competitive</strong>, whether at the training room or at some silly games, he hardly even likes to lose. He isn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, and while Owen may become <strong>self-conscious</strong>, he hardly likes to admit it. In fact, Owen may even react with <strong>aggression</strong> at the perceived mockery. Only few would actually have the chance of seeing Owen when he's truly relaxed, he isn't exactly very <strong>trusting</strong> of others.
