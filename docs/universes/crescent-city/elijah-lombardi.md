<ul>
    <li>An orphan surviving in the streets of Sicily, Elijah was forced to learn how to use their magic from a young age to protect themselves in the crime-filled city. Unfortunately for them, their unique use of magic and symbolism for their dual eye colors caught the eye of a certain mafia boss in Sicily.</li>
    <li>Just like that, Elijah was unofficially "adopted" in a mafia family and trained to be within their ranks. However, as training proceeded under the sharp eyes of Papa Enzo, who quickly found that despite their heterochromic eyes, Elijah had almost non-existent capabilities in the Time sphere. Unwilling to waste such a precious finding, he found someone capable of enhancing magic and forced them to apply those abilities onto Elijah.</li>
    <li>The magic enhancing process was long and painful, but with that, their Time magic finally manifested to an extent that satisfied Papa Enzo. The next few years were a life of crime with the mafia family, Elijah never liked any of it, but was forced to stay within line or be killed as a traitor.</li>
    <li>Luckily the chance for escape presented itself before Elijah when he was sent to New York as part of a scout party to determine whether the city was viable for expansion. Away from the physical grasp of Enzo meant Elijah could out power the others and escape, with a little help of some fire and a certain Hunter.Now, they move to New Orleans with the rest of the Association on their quest to protect Sleepers from atrocious Awakeneds like Enzo.</li>

<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Eagle's Eyes.</span> 
        Living a crime life for so long made Elijah wary of everything around him, constantly hyper alert while out and about. Enabling him to notice small changes or disturbances. Though they may not be the brightest, in a pinch, Elijah can still find ways to solve his problems. Advantage on all Wits rolls.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Ahead of Time.</span> 
        Along with catching a glimpse of what could happen in the future thanks to his Time sphere, Elijah has a higher chance at dodging and aiming his weapons. Advantage on all Dexterity rolls if he is fighting in self defense or to protect someone else.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Touch of Alteration.</span> 
        By manipulating minor characteristics and properties of an object, Elijah can change how they function or interact with the world. Such as weakening an object to be broken more easily, walking silently by dampening the surface, walking on walls by fusing his shoes and gloves to the wall temporarily. </li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">BANES</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Unwilling Subject.</span>  
        Elijah wasn’t willingly taught the Time Sphere, instead it was forcefully carved into his body to enhance its powers and control. As such, though Elijah may control time, his perception of time is skewered. He has a hard time getting the timing right, arriving on time and telling the time of day.  </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Mortal Body.</span> 
        He may be a mage with incredible powers, but Elijah is still a mortal human susceptible to all sorts of dangers. From diseases, injuries and mortality. He doesn’t have the resilience of a supernatural creature and can bleed out from wounds if not taken care of, especially when Elijah becomes a little too reckless when fighting.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Paradox Inducing.</span>  
        Playing around with Time and Matter could cause a huge paradox from a small mishap, causing the magic to retaliate against Elijah. Thus, he tried to be as careful as possible when dealing with his own magic and hopefully not cause a Masquerade Breach. The larger the effect, the more powerful the backlash could be. </li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight: bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">PASSIVE</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Tick Tock.</span>  
        By turning back time for a few seconds and looping, Elijah can gain a second chance at an action or performance. Words spoken and large events can’t be altered, and Sleepers are completely unaware of this change. Others can dispel if with a suitable time manipulation ability too. Reroll a dice roll, 3 times per roleplay.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Temporal Absorption.</span> 
        Stealing meaningless fractions of time from the people, objects and environment, Elijah builds up a reservoir of time energy to use on himself for healing purposes. By enhancing his injuries with its healing properties, it heals him or a selected target passively d2 HP per turn.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Chronology Lock.</span>  
        Putting a stop to time, Elijah freezes time for an entire location for a certain period of time, he can control who is frozen and who isn't. In this period, he can hold the time freeze as long as he hasn’t been attacked. If attacked, he must roll a Resolve check of 10 to maintain it. Limited twice per roleplay.</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">PRIMARY</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Control Matter</span>  
        Objects can be easily shaped or transformed by manipulating their properties, Elijah could cause dismantle and reconstruct a solid object, both systematically or to explode violently. He could also change their properties like lowering the melting point lower, or make something chemically volatile to oxygen with a combination. </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Desolated Demolition</span>  
        By accelerating time so fast, Elijah could cause a target or object to decay at high paces. As he is more proficient with Matter, any solid object can almost instantly be decayed into nothing but dust. Living targets are much harder for him to do so. Useful for destroying equipment or weapons of a target or breaking in. </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Atomize Reality</span>  
        Capable of controlling much larger atom change, Elijah can manipulate larger bursts of flames from a barrier to a forest fire, winds capable of knocking down trees, bolts of lightning and waves that can destroy parts of a buildings. However, these require immense control to manipulate and not lose control. </li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">SUPPORITVE</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Atom Control.</span>  
        Manipulating the atoms around him, Elijah can speed them up or slow them down for various effects. Capable of creating bursts of water, fog, lighting something on fire or huge gusts of air capable of knocking someone over. He can also create and direct electricity plus freeze bodies of water on some level.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Flip the Hourglass.</span>  
        Slowing down time in an area around himself, Elijah created a personal bubble where he is in control. Everyone else inside said bubble of 30 ft will be slowed, while Elijah and his chosen targets aren’t affected. They perceive these targets as moving faster rather than himself being slowed. Roll Intelligence to resist, failure will receive disadvantage on rolls. Lasts for d6 rounds. </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#50C878;letter-spacing:1px;">Transmute Elements.</span>  
        One element, material or object can be transformed into another. An intricate ability that requires Elijah to know of said object beforehand to build it. It can be as simple as turning solids into fog or mist to something as complicated as transmuting it into complex weapons such as a gun. Intelligence check to create complex transmutation, on failure, said transmutation only lasts for 2 rounds before crumbling. </li>
</ul>
