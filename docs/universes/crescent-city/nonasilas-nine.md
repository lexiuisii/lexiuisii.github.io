>  "*True Fae* are almost alien-like beings from a completely different realm, they are powerful and curious of the world. Some even sadistically entertained by the sufferings of mortals, while others toy with them. They don't understand the world very well, and can't stay away from their own for too long. Powerful, but they have also weakened themselves to enter the Material Plane for hedonistic enjoyments."

<p><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">CONTENT WARNING </span>Violence, War and Implied Deaths</p>

<ul>
    <li>Manifested so many years ago, in the age of wars and warriors. Nona was known as a different name and different title back then, just a mere Fae who loves pranks and chaos. As time grew, so did his powers. War is chaotic, and through that, Nona has gained many powers through its very essence.</li>
    <li>He was more human than most Fae, yet still never understanding them completely. Nona was met with traitors and rivals who wished he was gone, despised him for his powers and very existence. He loved, he lost, he grew bitter, and he got revenge... sort of.</li>
    <li>Nona never quite got over that ordeal, and persisted through the centuries in search for his goal. Wandering almost aimlessly through the vast world, lost and weary. He stumbled upon an odd little city, filled with many Awakeneds, ones he was searching for, and ones he was not quite expecting. </li>
    <li>Nona spent time here and slowly grew to like the little ones he found himself surrounded by. But he was still hung up over what had happened centuries ago, and a stray rumor easily led him away in search of a non-existent goal. When he finally returned, the little ones had grown old, distant and even different. He tries to reconnect, but Nona is still a Fae who can't keep up with the world. He got in big trouble and faced extreme consequences for his foolish actions. He is back... again, let's hope he can do better this time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Arcadian Monach.</span> 
       The power of titles, Nona can create contracts with the Wyrd to obtain more power and can appear in multiple forms. Appealing in his Realm, Actor, Prop, and Wisp forms. Thus, he can be at multiple places in different forms at once, they are the same entity but have overtime grown personalities and ideals of their own.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Amalgamated Mind.</span> 
        With a mind so wild and alien, not even Faes or Nona themself understand how his own mind works. Any attempts to use mind related abilities will instead be met with his odd Fae mind that is twisted and incomprehensible. Possession, mind manipulation, mind reading and fear inducing abilities have no effect on Nona.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Forgotten Realms.</span> 
        Nona can open up shadow-like portals for transportation. Enabling him to travel to any and all realms and locations in the blink of an eye. He can drag others with him or summon his servants from his own realm to serve him when needed. He might even trap targets in an entirely different realm or location. </li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">BANES</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Realm Traveler.</span>  
        As a Fae from Arcadia, traveling to the Material Plane will cause his powers to be significantly weakened while away from their home. Additionally, Nona can't stay in the Material Plane indefinitely and must return to Arcadia after a certain amount of time spent there. Staying too long will have consequences as they are cut off from their own realm for extended periods of time. </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Centurion's Creed.</span> 
       Contracts made by Nona and another individual must be upheld, if they were to be broken, either side will face its consequences. For Nona, it could mean retaliation from the magic of the Wyrd for breaking a term, if he were to swear a title on said contract, he could lose it forever.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Respect and Pride.</span>  
        As a Centurion, not only is Nona prideful of his title, he also follows a creed of sorts of his own. One of many, compels him to be polite and nice to an individual on their first encounter and introduction. He must always introduce himself to strangers and try to be "polite" and "nice", like giving them a greeting or welcoming them. Meaning he can not ambush anyone unless they already know him.</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight: bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">PASSIVE</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Amorphous Body.</span>  
        Nona’s body and appearance can easily be changed, from a human-like appearance to a dark inky blob and anything they can imagine. From shaping wings, appendages, claws and other bizarre features. He can also shapeshift his entire body into an entirely different creature, but will always appear black-coated with purple eyes.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Chaotic Entropy.</span> 
        By messing with the chaotic forces of the world, Nona can cause a disruption in reality and magic. Causing bouts of misfortune to happen at his command, and for magic to malfunction, backfire or be dispelled. Once every 5 rounds, Nona can attempt to dispel a magical ability or power.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Stygian Nightmare.</span>  
        Nona can create just about anything from shadows such as large chains, cages, weapons, armor and more. These constructs have 6 HP, and when attacking, targets roll a separate Resolve roll. If they fail to beat Nona’s roll, the damage dealt to him is halved.</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">PRIMARY</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Disturbance</span>  
        Objects can be easily shaped or transformed by manipulating their properties, Elijah could cause dismantle and reconstruct a solid object, both systematically or to explode violently. He could also change their properties like lowering the melting point lower, or make something chemically volatile to oxygen with a combination. </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Believe It or Not</span>  
        By accelerating time so fast, Elijah could cause a target or object to decay at high paces. As he is more proficient with Matter, any solid object can almost instantly be decayed into nothing but dust. Living targets are much harder for him to do so. Useful for destroying equipment or weapons of a target or breaking in. </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Phantasmal Lands</span>  
        Nona can cause magical wonders by interrupting the entropic and chaotic forces of the world. These don’t harm anyone, but can disturb or confuse someone. Ranging from large clouds of fog or smoke, knocking over something, sounds, untouchable illusions, starting small fires, turning invisible and more. Targets can potentially receive 2 rounds of disadvantage.</li>
</ul>

<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px; text-transform:uppercase">SUPPORITVE</span><br> 
<ul>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Paralysis of Shaodws.</span>  
        Enveloping his surroundings in shadowy darkness, those who are within this vicinity will be inflicted with the chilling sensation of paralysis. Which will cause them to be unable to move for a few moments. A useful ability for escape or crowd control. Targets who fail a Stamina check are stunned for d3 rounds.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Fae's Authority.</span>  
        Commanding lesser Fae to perform tasks, Nona can summon them from Arcadia and request for them to accomplish something for him. These lesser Fae tend to be ones loyal to him, and can have one specific ability that are usually tied to their nature, such as a light fae, a fire fae, a water fae.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color:#5A4FCF;letter-spacing:1px;">Mayhem's Darkness.</span>  
       The power of shadows, darkness and illusions can be gifted to those Nona deemed worthy, those who will be unwaveringly loyal to him, and those who will not mind the eternity of immortality. When the situation calls for it, he can call his summons to fight on his behalf. Even act as spies by sharing their senses too.</li>
