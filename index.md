                        <p>The Yè Guáng Clan, 夜光族 had been a proud and loyal pack that had followed Lady Shufen since her exile to San Francisco, as her bodyguards, underlings and enforcers. Becoming the guardian hounds that guard the night of San Francisco, effectively keeping out any... unruly individuals with a fear for fire. For generations, they have served her at every step, but it seems the newest addition of the family has started to cause some trouble.</p>
                        <p>The eldest son of the family has always been chosen as the head of the clan for many generations, and with the previous clan head’s favoritism, the eldest son had become haughty and arrogant. Jealousy between the siblings brewed and caused problems that ruined the reputation of the clan. Most notably, the fight between the two siblings that lit the house ablaze and forced the old clan head to retire.</p>
                        <p>It wasn't before long that the clan split into two sides with varying opinions, inside fighting that led to its downfall. In the end, the betrayal side led by the eldest son were exiled by Lady Shufen. The only mercy they received out of respect for the previous clan leaders. Now, their only choice was to call the daughter home to lead the clan despite her father’s disapproval. </p>

                        <p>Lin was born and raised in San Francisco, more so by the community and her own faction leader rather than her father. Her mama had passed away in a car crash when she was a young pup, and her father remarried and focused more on his heir than he did on Lin. She was nonetheless a lively pup that loved to bug and play with anyone who was willing to give her attention.</p>
                        <p>However, as she grew older… Lin became more temperamental from clan business. Serving as an underling that would do anything Lady Shufen commands, many who defy the Red Deer Court would often find a growling hound at their doorstep. Lin was willing to do anything to prove her worth to the people around, while still finding solace to those around her that were willing to put up with the fiery hound.</p>
                        <p>When the fight with her brother occurred, Lin was later reported missing as few witnesses would claim spotting the Tian Gou running away in the dead of night. Two years later, Lin would be called home by its elders and faction leader. Both to lead the crumbling clan and to serve the faction heir, which Lin reluctantly agreed if not for her adoptive brother's safety.</p>
